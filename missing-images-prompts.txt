NOTES FOR IMAGE GENERATION
================================================================================

1. CONSISTENCY: All images should maintain a consistent professional, corporate
   aesthetic that aligns with Hworld's brand identity.

2. COLOR SCHEME: Incorporate subtle gold/amber accent colors (#FFAD4A) as
   specified in each prompt. This is Hworld's secondary brand color. The
   accents should feel natural and integrated - through lighting, accessories,
   UI elements, or environmental details - not as obvious filters or overlays.

3. ASPECT RATIO: All images should be landscape orientation (approximately
   3:2 or 16:9 ratio) to fit the hero image placement on the service pages.

4. QUALITY: Generate at highest resolution possible, minimum 1200x800px for
   web display, preferably 2400x1600px for retina displays.

5. STYLE: Photorealistic is preferred over illustrated or AI-artistic styles
   to maintain professional credibility.

6. FILE FORMAT: Save as PNG for best quality, or high-quality JPG (90%+) for
   smaller file sizes.

7. NAMING: Use the exact filenames listed above (e.g., "4d-planning.png") and
   place in the /public folder.
